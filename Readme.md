By Benjamin Zhang and Travis Vuong
##Introduction

##Rules
###General

2 Players.

For this game a deck of 52 cards (A-K, no jokers) is required.

Each player has 2 lanes, one for red cards, one for black cards.

A player must win two rounds out of three in order to win the match.

Rounds and matches can end in a draw.

Each player is given 10 cards.

At the beginning of the game, a coin is flipped and whoever wins drafts first, and the other starts first.

###Phases

Coin Flip -> Draft Phase -> Turn Phase

###Drafting
As determined by the coin toss, whoever drafts first must discard one card from their hand, then draws one from the deck.

After doing so, the other player discards and draws.

The first player discards and draws again.

The other player discards then draws once more.

All cards discarded in the drafting phase go into the side pile.

After the drafting phase is done, the first turn can begin.

###Rounds
The player who drafted second, places the first card.

Each turn a player can play one card or pass.

If a player passes they won't be able to put down a card until the next round.

The remaining player can play as many cards as they want until they also pass.

Whoever has the highest point value, after both players pass, wins the round.

If a player wins a round, they draw a card.

When a round ends, all cards on each player's side of the field will go into their respective discard pile regardless of original ownership.

All modifiers and side cards go to the side pile.

For the next round, the player that went second goes first.

##Cards
Aces - Modifiers

2- Modifiers

3- Nullify

4 -> 10 - Value Cards

J and K - Spies (draw 1, has a value of 5 and is placed in the opponents field)

Q - Medics (revive 1 card from the player's discard pile, has a value of 5 and placed in the opponents field)


###Modifiers and Nullifies
If a row modifier is played, then all cards with the same color are worth 1 each.

If another modifier is placed, then it replaces the existing modifier. 

If a Nullify is placed, it replaces the current modifier and no modifier is in effect.

A modifier can even be placed on a modifier if it has the same effect.

A nullify can be played even if there is no modifier on the field.

###Spies and Medics
All face cards are worth 5 in the specified row for the opposing player.

A spy allows the player that plays it to draw 1 card.

A medic allows the player that plays it to revive 1 value or spy card from their discard pile and place it on the field.
